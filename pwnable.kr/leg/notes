pc = current address + 8 (in arm state)
r3 looks like register where ret value is stored
lr stores ret addr

key1: r3 = 0x00008cdc + 8
key2: r3 = 0x00008d04 + 8 + 4
key3: r3 = 0x00008d80

key = 0x00008cdc + 8 + 0x00008d04 + 8 + 0x00008d80 = 108400

SOLUTION:
	./leg
	108400
FLAG:
My daddy has a lot of ARMv5te muscle!
