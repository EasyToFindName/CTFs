looks vulnerable:

if (bet > cash) //If player tries to bet more money than player has
{
    printf("\nYou cannot bet more money than you have.");
    printf("\nEnter Bet: ");
    scanf("%d", &bet);
    return bet;
}

=> ability to bypass check if enter invalid bet twice
bet is signed => can write big negative number and loose to increase cash

SOLUTION: 
	Enter Bet: $-10000000
